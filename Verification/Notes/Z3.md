APIs in multiple languages (c/c++/py)

For assignments, you **must** encode your logic as *propositional* logic, not any other types of logic.

You can make expressions via Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs):
- Create a symbol, e.g., $p$
- Assign it to an AST
- Create a negation AST: $\lnot p$
- Tell Z3 to combine different ASTs via an operator (e.g., or) 
	- This yields your formula, e.g., $\lnot p \lor q$
