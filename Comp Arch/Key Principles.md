# Key principles of computer design

## Parallelism
- Instruction-level
- System-level
- Data-level

## Instruction-level parallelism
- Processor level
- Instructions of processor executed in stages
- Pipelining is the most common ILP method 

## System-level parallelism
- Multiple processors, memory, storage, etc.
- Workload spread across resources
- Scalability is a major design consideration
- Two common types:
	- Shared-memory architecture
		- Each processor connects to same mem
	- Distributed memory arch
		- Each processor has its own isolated mem
