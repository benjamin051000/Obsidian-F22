Abstraction: Simplification of a concept by dropping some details that are not deemed important for achieving a specific goal.

- Abstraction can help verify large or infinite spaces by mapping the original state space to a smaller domain.
- The challenge is to find the right abstraction to use.

Approximation: Preserve the original problem, but provide an imprecise solution.

- Approximation can help verify large or infinite spaces by approximating intermediate steps during verification
- The challenge is to find a  balance between precision and efficiency tradeoff

Considering the previous example:

- What if we only cared about one variable? (x or y only)
