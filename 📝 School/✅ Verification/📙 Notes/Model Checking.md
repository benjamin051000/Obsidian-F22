Given a transition system $T$ and a temporal logic formula $\phi$, decide whether $T$ satisfies $\phi$, $T \models \phi$.

- $T$ is a model of $\phi$, i.e., an example/satisfying transition system that exemplifies $\phi$ defined behaviors.
- Generic definition, details of this change based on type of temporal logic being used.
