Moore's Law
- IC transistor capcity doubles every 18months - 2 years
- 3nm processes (transistor gate lengths) have allowed for the creation of SoCs

- SoCs are basically defined by systems that are interconnected via a protocol.
- Tightly integrated (e.g., Intel modern CPUs) or loosely integrated 

- SoC = Chip + Software + Integration

- SoC Hardware
	- Embedded processor
	- Hardware IPs
	- Peripherals, analog circuitry
	- Embedded memory
	- Interconnect
- SoC Software
	- OS
	- Simulator
	- Firmware
	- Drivers
	- Protocol stacks
