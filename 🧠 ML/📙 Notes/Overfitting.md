# Overfitting
Model attempts to do crazy stuff to minimize error.
- Example: 10-term polynomial: weight coefficients become extremely large
- Graphing the sin wave shows it is trying to go through every single point rather than approximating them

## Options for overfitting
- Add more data
- Cross-validation
- Ensemble learning
- [[Occam's Razor]]
