# What is (Artificial) Intelligence?

Alan Turing: "Can machines think?"

## Turing Test
Basically, the evaluator speaks to another party (human or computer). If you can't tell whether you're talking to a human or computer, it passes the Turing Test.

Ideal approach:
- Systems that think/act rationally

Human approach:
- Systems that think/act like humans

Francois Chollet later proposed a new measure of intelligence
- Based on Algorithmic Information Theory, lots more math stuff

# Types of AI
## Weak (narrow) AI
- AI focused on a specific task
- Drives most of AI that surrounds us today

- Google Translate
	- Does one thing

## Strong AI
- AGI: Artificial General Intelligence
	- AI rivals intelligence of human
- ASI: Artificial Super Intelligence
	- AI surpasses that of a human
	- Nowhere near this

# Machine learning is:
- Solve intelligent tasks by learning from experience/data
- Not explicitly programmed

General AI does not necessarily use old data/experience
- Rules from input to output are hard-coded
- In ML, the system changes as it learns more and more 
- Example: Doctors use a list of criteria to determine whether a patient is sick or not
	- Takes intelligence to build the table
	- Table does not change over time
	- Machine learning could change criteria over time

## Deep learning
Uses specific architecture (mapper functions) called Artifical Neural Networks

In ML, you have to hard-code features out of unstructured data.
- Take lots of time and expertise

Deep Learning extracts features automatically.
