# What is (Artificial) Intelligence?

Alan Turing: "Can machines think?"

## Turing Test
Basically, the evaluator speaks to another party (human or computer). If you can't tell whether you're talking to a human or computer, it passes the Turing Test.

Ideal approach:
- Systems that think/act rationally

Human approach:
- Systems that think/act like humans

Francois Chollet later proposed a new measure of intelligence
- Based on Algorithmic Information Theory, lots more math stuff

# Types of AI
## Weak (narrow) AI
- AI focused on a specific task
- Drives most of AI that surrounds us today

- Google Translate
	- Does one thing

## Strong AI
- AGI: Artificial General Intelligence
	- AI rivals intelligence of human
- ASI: Artificial Super Intelligence
	- AI surpasses that of a human
	- Nowhere near this
