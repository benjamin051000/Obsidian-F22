Machine Learning algorithms fall into one of the following categories:

## Supervised Learning
Model learns from labeled data

You must:
- Collect data
- Label the data

## Unsupervised Learning
Model learns from unlabeled data

You must:
- Collect data

- Algorithm labels the data itself

## Semi-Supervised
- Collecting and labeling data takes a long time
- Semi- labels some data, not all of it 

## Reinforcement Learning
System takes action based on reward or penalty

Example: Robot has goal to vacuum the house without hitting any walls
- System uses inputs (vision)
- Move around house without hitting stuff
- If it hits a wall, add a penalty
	- Now it will learn to not do that anymore
- Very popular in robotics

# Other types
## Multiple Instance Learning
Model will learn based on multiple-instance labels that have a particular form of imprecision

## Active Learning
(type of supervised learning)
Model learns by obtaining labels online from user/oracle in intelligent fashion

## Transfer Learning
Transfer learnt knowledge from similar previous task


# Supervised Learning
Example: Macaws vs Conures

## Classifiers
### Discriminative

### Generative
